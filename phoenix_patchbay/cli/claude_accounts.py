"""Claude credential-store account switching.

Claude Code reads its OAuth credentials from the directory named by
``CLAUDE_SECURESTORAGE_CONFIG_DIR`` (falling back to the regular config dir).
Only the *credential store* moves — ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` is left alone, so
sessions, projects, skills, MCP servers and settings stay shared.

That split is what makes account switching useful mid-conversation: when one
subscription hits its rate limit, pointing the credential store at a second
account lets ``claude --resume`` continue the *same* session on the other
subscription, exactly like running a wrapper script that exports the variable.

Platform note: on macOS the directory is hashed into the Keychain service name;
on Linux it holds a ``.credentials.json`` file. Both honour the variable, so the
same config works on either host.
