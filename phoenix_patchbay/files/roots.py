The browser used to be rooted at ``~/.phoenix-patchbay`` alone, which meant the project
directories configured in ``project_roots`` — the ones an agent actually works
in — were unreachable from Telegram. Those roots are already an explicit,
user-maintained allowlist, so widening the browser to them adds no new trust.

Containment is still enforced on every navigation: a resolved path must sit
inside one of these roots or it is refused.
