"""Keeping agent-written handoffs out of the user's git history.

``.git/info/exclude`` rather than ``.gitignore``: it is untracked, so the agent
never modifies a file git is watching and nothing can reach a commit by
accident. A ``.gitignore`` entry stays opt-in by the user.

It is re-applied on every write rather than once, because re-cloning a
repository recreates ``.git`` and takes the exclusion with it while leaving the
working tree looking untouched.

Ignore rules do not apply to files git already tracks, so the exclusion has to
exist *before* the first write, never after it.
