"""Where a conversation's handoff lives.

The key carries chat *and* topic because two conversations can be bound to the
same folder — topics 97 and 110 both point at the same repository today — and a
single per-repository file would have them overwriting each other's working
state silently.

The sign is stripped from the chat id. A filename beginning with ``-`` is read
as a flag by most of coreutils, so ``rm``, ``grep`` and ``cp`` all misbehave on
one, usually at the worst moment.
