"""Refusing to start a turn the workspace cannot host.

A fallback location would work today and clutter the system tomorrow: a second
directory nobody is looking at, filling with files that were meant to live
beside the work. So this gate repairs what is unambiguously safe and otherwise
stops before a single token is spent, naming the file and the reason so it can
be fixed and retried.

Safe repairs are creating ``handoffs/`` and adding the git exclusion. Never
``chmod``, never ``chown``, never a tracked ``.gitignore`` — a gate that quietly
widens permissions is worse than the problem it solves.
