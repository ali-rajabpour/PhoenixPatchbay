"""Which conversations are owed a handoff re-injection.

Compaction keeps the same session id, so ``is_new`` is False on the turn after
it and the handoff would never be put back in front of the model — consolidation
would write a careful document that nobody then reads. The boundary sets a flag;
the next turn takes it.

Memory only, like the other pending-state holders beside it: a flag that
survived a restart would re-inject into a conversation that has moved on.
