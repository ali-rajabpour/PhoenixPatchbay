"""Scheduled wipe of the Consult topic.

Three kinds of residue outlive a consultation: the files in its directory, the
messages in the topic, and the CLI session keyed to that topic. Deleting the
files clears one of them. ``deleteForumTopic`` clears all three at once — it
removes every message with the topic, and the replacement topic gets a new id,
which is a new session key, so nothing can be resumed into it.

The schedule is user-chosen, so the pinned notice is generated from it rather
than promising "daily" regardless. A notice that misstates when data disappears
is worse than no notice: it is the sentence someone decides what to paste on.
