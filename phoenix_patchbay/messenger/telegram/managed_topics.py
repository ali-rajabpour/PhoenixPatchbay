"""Topics the bot creates and maintains, and the notices pinned in them.

Telegram has no API to list a forum's topics: ``createForumTopic`` exists,
discovery does not. Existence therefore cannot be checked, only remembered, so
the ids live in a state file on the same volume as the rest of ``.phoenix-patchbay`` and
survive image rebuilds.

Liveness is proved by *editing* the pinned notice to its current text. That is
idempotent, doubles as the check, and keeps the wording current when it
changes. A failed edit means the topic or message is gone, and it is recreated.

Off by default. A bot that creates topics and pins messages in someone's group
on first run, without being asked, is not a good guest.
