"""The inline menu, and the one-button panel that opens it.

Telegram's toggle beside the input box is bound to reply keyboards and cannot
be pointed at anything else. So the panel holds a single button, ``/menu``,
and everything after that is an inline keyboard on a message.

That split is the point. Exactly one command is ever sent as text — and it is
deleted on arrival — while the menu itself is callbacks, which never enter the
message stream. Nothing here can be mistaken for something to send to the
agent, and nothing has to be intercepted to keep it out.

Items are fixed rather than filtered by state. A button that appears and
disappears reads as a broken screen, and a stable grid is easier to aim at on a
phone; where state matters it is shown in the header instead.
