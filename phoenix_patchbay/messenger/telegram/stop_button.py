"""The Stop control on a running turn — Ctrl+C, as a button.

Work that used to be handed to a background task now runs in the
conversation's own session, so a turn can last minutes or hours. The only
thing missing from the terminal experience was a way to say "no, not like
that" without waiting for it to finish.

Stop sends SIGINT, which the CLI handles itself: it records the interruption
in the transcript, closes the outstanding tool call, and leaves the session
resumable — verified against the real binary before this existed. Whatever is
queued behind the turn then runs immediately, which is what Ctrl+C does in a
terminal.
