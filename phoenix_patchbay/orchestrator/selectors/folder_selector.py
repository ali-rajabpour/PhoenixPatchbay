"""Folder picker for the binding gate and for ``/folder``.

Folders are offered, never inferred. The catalogue is ``project_roots``; the
choice is what gets recorded. A conversation works in the folder its user
picked, or in the shared workspace because they picked that.

``Shared workspace`` is always offered. Without it a topic could never be used
for plain conversation, and a gate with no acceptable answer is a lock rather
than a question. It is a choice, not a default — nothing selects it for you.
