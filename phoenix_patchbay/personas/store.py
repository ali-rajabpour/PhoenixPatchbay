"""Per-conversation persona choices, and the prompts held while choosing.

Kept beside the session store rather than inside it: the choice has to be made
*before* a session exists — that is the point of asking on a new conversation —
and the existing session record is created by the first run.

The chosen persona is persisted so a restart does not re-ask. The held prompt is
not: if the bot restarts between the question and the answer, the user taps
again and their message is gone. Persisting a queued instruction across a
restart, to be executed later without them watching, is worse than asking twice.
