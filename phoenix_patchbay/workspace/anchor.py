"""Rewrite workspace-relative paths in prompt text to absolute ones.

patchbay's own files — ``tools/``, ``memory_system/``, ``cron_tasks/`` and the
rest — live in the shared workspace. Prompt text all over the codebase names
them relatively, which is correct only while the CLI's working directory *is*
the workspace.

A conversation bound to a project directory breaks that assumption: the agent
is told it has tools under a path that does not exist in the user's repo, goes
looking for a workspace it was promised, and behaves as though it is in the
wrong place. Worse, an instruction to write ``memory_system/MAINMEMORY.md``
resolves inside the user's repository.

Nothing fails when this happens — no exception, no log line — so it is fixed
centrally rather than by trusting every prompt author to remember.
