"""Which folder a chat or topic works in, and how it got there.

A binding is a record of consent. It exists only because someone tapped a
button naming this folder for this topic, which is what separates it from
``project_roots``: that map is a *catalogue* of directories the user is willing
to work in, and an entry there is an offer, never a decision.

The two used to be the same thing, resolved by matching a topic's name. Topic
names are learned from ``forum_topic_created`` events and cached in memory, so
every restart silently un-matched every mapping and work ran in the shared
workspace with nothing said. Failing quietly in the direction of "somewhere
else entirely" is the reason this store exists.

The choice is persisted so a restart does not re-ask. The message held while
asking is not, matching ``PersonaStore``: replaying a queued instruction after
a restart, with nobody watching, is worse than asking twice.

        Used for the General thread of a forum group. General's messages carry
        no ``message_thread_id``, so they collapse onto the chat-level key that
        a private chat would use — which meant a message typed outside a topic
        could bind a folder and start a fresh conversation in another topic's
        project directory, with the folder picker as the only warning.

        A protected key reads as "answered, shared workspace": the gate never
        asks, ``resolve`` never yields a directory, and ``set`` refuses. That
        covers stale entries written before this rule existed as well as any
        future caller, which is why the check lives here rather than at each
        of the four paths that can write a binding.

        Held in memory on purpose. Unlike the topic *names* whose in-memory
        cache failed (it was consulted when no update was present), this is
        re-derived from every incoming update, and every path that could bind
        is reached by an update from the same chat — so the mark is always set
