"""An unlimited turn's deadline follows the last sign of life.

The old rule only extended when output had appeared within the previous 30
seconds *of the moment the deadline fired*. An agent that had been working
steadily for hours but happened to be inside a two-minute quiet tool call at
exactly the wrong second was killed as if it had hung. What we want is the
plain reading: die after N hours of silence, and nothing else.
