"""Translations must not contain double-escaped sequences.

A string written into TOML through a generator that escapes backslashes ends up
as ``\\\\n`` in the file, which TOML parses back to a literal backslash-n. The
result reaches the chat as the characters a user sees as `\\n` rather than a line
break — invisible to lint, types and every behavioural test, because the value
is technically a valid string throughout.

This caught four keys across eight locales after they had already shipped.
