"""A forum's General thread can never hold a folder binding.

General is the one thread whose messages carry no ``message_thread_id``, so it
collapses onto the same chat-level key a private chat uses. That is how a
message typed outside a topic once bound a project folder and started a fresh
conversation in it: the topic's own session, with all its history, was still on
disk and simply never consulted again.

Four separate paths can write a binding (the gate's picker, the picker
callback, /folder, and the file browser's "bind here"), so the rule is enforced
in the store rather than at each of them. These tests pin both halves: the
predicate that recognises General, and the store that refuses it.
