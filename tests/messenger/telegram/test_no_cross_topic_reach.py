"""No command may act on a conversation other than the one it was sent in.

`/new @topicname` reset another topic's session without entering it. It was a
convenience that quietly undid the property the whole session model exists to
provide: a topic is a machine of its own, and what happens to it happens in it.
The command is gone, and so is the reverse lookup that made addressing another
topic by name possible — a capability nothing else needed.
