"""Injected prompts must not name patchbay's files by relative path.

The bug this exists for: a conversation bound to a project directory runs with
that directory as cwd, but the hooks told the agent its tools were at
``tools/task_tools/``. They are not — they are in the shared workspace. The
agent went looking for a workspace it had been promised and could not find,
which reads to the user as "the folder binding is broken".

Nothing failed. No exception, no log line; the agent simply answered from a
directory it did not understand.
