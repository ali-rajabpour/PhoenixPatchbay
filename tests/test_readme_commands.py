"""The README's command table has to match the bot people actually run.

It drifted badly once: it advertised `/tasks` and `/reset` months after both
were deleted, and omitted `/clear`, `/compact` and `/handoff` — the three most
useful ones. Documentation nobody can trust costs more than none, so the drift
is a test failure rather than a thing to notice later.
